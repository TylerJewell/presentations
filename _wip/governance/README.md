# AI Governance Deck — Canonical Specification

This is the generic, customer-agnostic version of Akka's AI-governance narrative: ten
operating principles, told as one continuous story, bracketed by a title and close slide.

## Source of truth

The narrative here is not invented by this deck — it's a rendering of two upstream
sources, in this priority order when they conflict:

1. **Derive from this version of Tyler Jewell's 10-principle script in #governance** (Slack, `C0AASAK640K`,
   [permalink](https://typesafe.slack.com/archives/C0AASAK640K/p1790204420527749)) — the
   actual script this deck is built from, each principle mapped to one slide. Treat the
   **most recent** of Tyler's messages as authoritative where an earlier one disagrees. 
   - We may blend some details of the principles for clarity or organization, but keep to 10. 

   
2. **The `governance-explainability` repo's canonical specs** (a separate, akka-org repo —
   paths below are repo-relative within it, not links from here) — the enforced, versioned
   product truth that the narrative must stay honest to. Key pointers:
   - `specs/README.md` — navigation index for every canonical spec; its "Canonical specs"
     table names the single owner of each concept.
   - `framework/schema/control.schema.yaml` — the enforced control-mechanism taxonomy
     (currently v2.6). This is machine-checked (`tools/auditors/10-mechanism-coverage/`),
     so it's the hardest source available for "what are the control types."
   - `specs/vision/evalmatrix.md` — the Eval Matrix model and mechanism list in narrative
     form.
   - `specs/platform/agentgateway-enforceable-controls.md` — the gateway/non-Akka-agent
     enforcement story (Principle 9).
   - `specs/vision/governance-workflow.md` — a four-page workflow narrative; useful for
     the "why," but dated 2026-06-13 and behind the schema on specifics (e.g. its
     lifecycle framing predates later detail) — don't treat it as more current than the
     schema or Tyler's Slack script.
   - Live console (`akka-console-ai-canvas`, Verify → Verdicts) — the source for the
     **verdict vocabulary** (Upheld / Breached / Inconclusive / Error). This vocabulary is
     product-UI terminology, not defined in any spec file or Slack message found so far;
     treat the running console as ground truth for it.

When the deck and a source disagree, the source wins — fix the deck, don't reinterpret
the source.

## The ten principles → slides

| # | Folder | Principle (Tyler's wording, condensed) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `01-posture` | Risk posture is defined independently of the system, then applied uniformly with enforcement. |
| 2 | `02-lifecycle` | Define your risk, identify your controls, sign those controls, enforce them, measure compliance. |
| 3 | `03-control-types` | Controls are a discrete, provable check, reducing to **five** types: guardrails, evals, humans, gates, sanitizers — not a sixth "policy" type. |
| 4 | `04-control-sources` | Controls are derived from: AI regulation, corporate standard, or written by an individual. |
| 5 | `05-controls-as-software` | Controls are managed like software — packaged into a signed, versioned bundle that is applied discretely to a given agentic system. |
| 6 | `06-trace-outcomes` | Control outcomes are traced with the same infrastructure as the AI system itself. |
| 7 | `07-three-environments` | Environments — documentation stores, pre-production (testing), production — aggregate into one compliance view. |
| 8 | `08-drift` | Drift: comparing control outcomes for the same model/agent/system over time (stored outcomes, EvalKit/RedKit experimentation). |
| 9 | `09-ai-gateway` | Akka provides an AI gateway, agent runtime, and control runtime in the same environment — controls enforce on Akka agents **and** (mostly) non-Akka agents. |
| 10 | `10-tokenomics` | Token visibility across all models/agents enables cost governance — budgeting, chargeback, real-time optimization. |

Plus `00-title` and `zz-thankyou` bracketing the ten.

## Known gaps against the canonical source

These are tracked here rather than silently corrected, so the next slide-finalization
pass has a clear punch list:

- **Human-control sub-flavors are unresolved upstream.** A Slack thread
  ([permalink](https://typesafe.slack.com/archives/C0AASAK640K/p1789651125909609), same
  week as the 10-principle script) proposed five flavors for the `human` mechanism
  (decision / authorization / monitoring / feedback / halt), but ends without Tyler
  confirming that over an earlier three-form framing from a GitHub issue. Doesn't affect
  this deck today — "Human" is a single slide, not broken into flavors — but don't invent
  a flavor breakdown here without re-checking that thread first.

## Build

```
cd _wip/governance && python3 builder/build.py
```

Output lands at `generated/overview/index.html`. Pass `--mode`, `--presenter`, or `--out`
as documented in `builder/build.py`.

## Demo

See `PRESENTER-RUNBOOK.md` for desktop setup, console startup, and the slide-by-slide
walk with demo cues. `SPEAKER-NOTES.md` is the talk-track source of truth per slide.

## Customer decks

A customer-specific copy is a standalone seed of `builder/`, `shell/`, `slides/`, and
`assets/` from this deck. No customer name, ask, or live tenant data belongs in this repo.
